## The Challange

A class of 40 primary school children was asked to play a simple game.
In this game, students were asked to choose and write on a piece of paper, their favourite colour from a fixed list.
The teacher then collects the papers.

The list of available colours are:
"red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "white"

The teacher then collects the pieces and wants to know which colour(s) have the longest consecutive sequence.
Devise the longestSequence() function to print the colour and its longest sequence.

Example 1:
"red", "red", "red", "yellow", "white", "blue", "blue", "blue", "green", . . .

“red” and “blue” has the longest sequence of 3.

Example 2:
"red", "red", "yellow ", "yellow", "yellow", "yellow", "blue", "red", "red", . . .

“yellow” has the longest sequence of 4.
